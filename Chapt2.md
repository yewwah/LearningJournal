**Summary**  
Learning about bayes theorem 
- Directed Acyclic graphs -> Bayesian Network 
  - A node is independent of other non-descendants given its parents 
  - Summing up / Integarting all possible situations allows you to drop the condition.
  - Independent Maps 
    - Encodes some of the independence assumptions in the graphs 
  - Perfect Maps
    - All the independencies in the graphs are shown
